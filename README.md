A user can efficiently manage blood donation, storage, and distribution processes. This project is built using C++ and have utilized OOPs concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to model real-world entities such as donors, blood bags, and recipients, facilitating efficient data organization and manipulation. By providing a centralized platform for managing donor records, blood inventory, and transfusion data, the system streamlined operations, reduced administrative burden, and enhanced patient care.
